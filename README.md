![Port Scanner](port-scanner.png)

This is a simple port scanner implemented in Python using the socket module. It allows you to scan a range of ports on a target machine to determine which ports are open and accepting connections.

## Features

- Scans a range of ports on a target machine
- Determines if a port is open or closed
- Provides basic error handling for network connectivity issues

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the `portscanner.py` file.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where `portscanner.py` is located.
4. Run the following command:

```shell
python portscanner.py <ip> -p <1-1000>

<ip>: IP address or hostname of the target machine you want to scan.
-p: Optional flag to specify the range of ports to scan. If not provided, it will scan the port number provided as the third argument.
<1-1000>: Range of ports to scan, e.g., 1-1000. You can also specify a single port number instead of a range.
Examples
#To scan all ports on localhost:
python portscanner.py localhost -p 1-65535

#To scan a specific range of ports on a remote machine:
python portscanner.py 192.168.0.1 -p 80-100
```
Note: This port scanner is intended for educational and testing purposes only. Always obtain proper authorization before scanning any target machine.
